Results obtained by three algorithms on problems of various dimensions are reported.

The directory AlgoY contains stats files for the 59 problems of various dimensions solved by algorithm Y. The results for three algorithms are given.

The stats file named statsX.txt corresponds to the results on the problem number X. The first line in statsX.txt specifies the dimension of the problem X. Each subsequent line corresponds to a single evaluation of the problem Y and report all the outputs (objective and constraints). The number of outputs varies depending on the problem considered. The first output on a line is always the objective function value and the remaining outputs are the constraint function values.

All trial points evaluated by an algorithm Y are reported in the order of production of the points.
