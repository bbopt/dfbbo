Results obtained on 54 problems of dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10 and 20 are reported for three algorithms.

The directory DimX/AlgoY contains the stats files for the problem of dimension X obtained by algorithm Y. 

In a DimX/AlgoY directory, the statsZ.txt file contains some of the evaluations performed on problem Z.

Each line of a stats file reports an evaluation number and the corresponding best feasible function value obtained during optimization. The objective function value is obtained for a given trial point that is not reported in the stats file. All inequality constraints are verified for the trial point and are also not reported.
