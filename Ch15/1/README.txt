The directories Algo_x contain history files for 25 instances of the same constrained minimization problem with 8 variables.  The instances differ by their starting point.  Each line in a history file corresponds to a single evaluation.  The first 8 entries of a line are the variables, the next three variables are the constraint values, and the last entry is the objective function value.  A star at the end of a line indicates that the line corresponds to a surrogate problem.  All evaluations performed by an algorithm are included in the order of evaluation.
